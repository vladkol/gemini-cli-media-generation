# Creative Brief: Project Squirrel Beach Invite

**Logline:** A charismatic and slightly hyperactive squirrel takes a break from his beach vacation to personally invite AI developers to a series of "Accelerate AI with Cloud Run" workshops.

**Overall Visual Style:** Bright, sunny, and professional, yet funny. The video should have a cinematic feel, with a shallow depth of field to keep the focus on our squirrel protagonist. The style should be similar to a high-quality nature documentary, but with a talking animal.

**Key Characters:**

*   **Squeaky the Squirrel:** A standard grey squirrel, but with an unusually expressive face and a lot of personality. He's energetic, fast-talking, and passionate about AI. He is wearing a tiny "Google" t-shirt.

**Key Items/Props:**

*   **Acorn:** Squeaky might be holding a prized acorn, which he gestures with for emphasis.
*   **Miniature Laptop (optional):** We could have a shot where he's typing furiously on a tiny laptop on the beach.

**Environment Bible:**

*   **The Beach:** A beautiful, sunny beach with white sand, gentle turquoise waves, and a few palm trees in the background. It should look like a paradise, creating a funny contrast with the tech-focused topic.
