# Gemini CLI Video Assistant

A demonstration of using [MCP Servers for Genmedia in Gemini CLI](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/vertex-ai-creative-studio/tree/main/experiments/mcp-genmedia/sample-agents/geminicli)
with planned iterative ideation and media generation.

Files in `prompts`, `generated_images` and `generated_videos` directories
are examples of using the setup for creating a video with the following initial idea:

    I want to create a viral funny video with a squirrel on a beach inviting all AI developers
    to "Accelerate AI with Cloud Run" workshops.

It uses Imagen 4 and Veo 3 models through **MCP Servers for Genmedia**.

## NOTE

This project is a demonstration of vibe coding intended to provide a trustworthy and verifiable example that developers and researchers can use. It is not intended for use in a production environment.
