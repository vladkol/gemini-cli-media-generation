# Gemini CLI Video Assistant

A demonstration of using [MCP Servers for Genmedia in Gemini CLI](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/vertex-ai-creative-studio/tree/main/experiments/mcp-genmedia/sample-agents/geminicli)
with planned iterative ideation and media generation.

Files in `prompts`, `generated_images` and `generated_videos` directories
are examples of using the setup for creating a video with the following idea:

    I want to create a viral funny video with an animal inviting
    all AI developers to "Accelerate AI with Cloud Run" workshops.

It uses Veo 3 through **MCP Servers for Genmedia**
and new Gemini Flash Image Generation model
as a way to preserve shot and character consistency
in multi-shot AI videos.

## NOTE

This project is a demonstration of vibe coding intended to provide a trustworthy and verifiable example that developers and researchers can use. It is not intended for use in a production environment.
