**Master Shot Prompt**

*   **Scene Description:** A highly detailed, photorealistic, vibrant, and eye-catching shot of a cute capybara on a sunny beach. The capybara sits next to a small, colorful surfboard with 'Cloud Run' written on it. The background has soft white sand and gentle turquoise waves. The capybara looks directly into the camera with a friendly expression, all in a 16:9 aspect ratio.
*   **Action:** The capybara gives a slight, friendly nod as it begins to speak. Its mouth moves in perfect synchronization with the words. The shot is stable, as if filmed on a high-quality smartphone.
*   **Audio - Dialogue:**
    *   **Speaker:** Capy (the capybara)
    *   **Dialogue:** "Hey AI devs! Ready to ride the wave of innovation? Come join us for the 'Accelerate AI with Cloud Run' workshops."
    *   **Voice:** Capy's voice is surprisingly deep and resonant, yet warm and friendly. It has a calm, laid-back "surfer dude" cadence. The articulation is clear, as if recorded with a high-quality microphone close by.
*   **Audio - Soundscape:**
    *   **Ambiance:** The gentle sound of small ocean waves lapping on the shore.
    *   **Spot Effects:** Faint, distant seagulls.
    *   **Music:** A subtle, upbeat, and slightly quirky ukulele track starts softly as Capy begins speaking.
