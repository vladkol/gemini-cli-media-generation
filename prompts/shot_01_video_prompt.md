A close-up, vertical, mobile phone video of Chip, a clever-looking squirrel, wearing a tiny dark hoodie. He is on a sunny beach, with sand and blurry ocean waves in the background. The lighting is bright and natural. The squirrel is looking directly at the camera, gesticulating with his tiny paws as he speaks. His mouth should be open as if he's in the middle of a sentence. The video should have a shaky, candid, 'shot-on-a-mobile-phone' feel.
**Audio:** Chip's voice is fast-paced, high-pitched but masculine, and full of technical jargon. The sound of gentle waves and distant seagulls is in the background. He says, 'Struggling to get your models from notebook to production? Is scaling your AI giving you a headache?'
