A medium, eye-level photo of the squirrel on the beach. He is standing and holding a folded tiny beach chair under his arm. His tiny black aviator sunglasses are still on. He is looking back over his shoulder at the camera with a determined expression, as if he's about to leave. The background is the same beautiful beach with his sandcastle still visible. The image should be bright, sunny, and look like it was taken with a high-quality mobile phone camera.
