Starting from the provided image, the squirrel, Squeaky, says 'Gonna get my models ready for a run. You better register for a workshop.' As he speaks, he quickly folds his tiny beach chair, tucks it under his arm, gives one last determined look to the camera, and then scurries off to the side, out of the frame. The camera remains steady. The audio includes his clear voice, the sound of him folding the chair, and his feet scurrying on the sand.
