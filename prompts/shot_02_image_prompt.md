A horizontal, mobile phone photo of Chip, the squirrel in a dark hoodie, on a sunny beach. He has a tiny, open backpack on the sand next to him and is in the middle of putting a miniature, open laptop into it. Chip is looking over his shoulder towards the camera with a friendly, inviting expression, as if he's giving one last piece of advice before leaving. The image should feel like a candid, shaky snapshot.
