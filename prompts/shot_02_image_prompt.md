Using the previous shot's image as a reference for the character and environment, create a new keyframe where the capybara is now walking towards the camera along the same beach. The capybara should be captured mid-stride, looking directly at the camera with the same friendly and inviting expression. The lighting, vibrant color, and overall photorealistic style should be perfectly consistent with the first shot. The image must be in a 16:9 aspect ratio.
