A close-up, vertical, mobile phone photo of Chip, a clever-looking squirrel. Chip is wearing a miniature dark-colored hoodie. He is on a sunny beach, with sand and blurry ocean waves in the background. The lighting is bright and natural. The squirrel is looking directly at the camera, mouth slightly open, with an excited and enthusiastic expression, as if captured mid-sentence. The image should feel like a candid, shaky snapshot.
