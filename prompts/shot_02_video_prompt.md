### **Master Shot Prompt (Shot 2):**

"**Original Keyframe Prompt:** A cinematic, photorealistic, eye-level, medium shot of Squeaky, a charming grey squirrel, on a pristine white sand beach. Squeaky is turned slightly to the side, with one paw lifted, as if he is about to run out of the frame. He has a look of excited determination on his face. He is still wearing his tiny, well-fitted t-shirt with the Google logo. The background of gentle, turquoise waves and a palm tree is consistent with the previous shot. The lighting is bright and sunny. The image should have a shallow depth of field.

**Video Action:** Squeaky excitedly says his line with perfect lip-sync, then immediately zips off-screen to the right, leaving a tiny puff of sand behind. The camera holds on the empty beach for a brief moment after he exits.

**Audio:**
*   **Squeaky's Voice:** The voice is high-pitched, clear, and full of excitement.
*   **Dialogue:** "I'm going to register right now!"
*   **Soundscape:** The sound of gentle ocean waves continues. A fast, cartoonish 'scampering' sound effect plays as Squeaky runs off."
