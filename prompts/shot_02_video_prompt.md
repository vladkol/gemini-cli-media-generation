A horizontal, mobile phone video of Chip, the squirrel in a dark hoodie, on a sunny beach. He has a tiny, open backpack on the sand next to him and is in the middle of putting a miniature, open laptop into it. Chip is looking over his shoulder towards the camera with a friendly, inviting expression, as if he's giving one last piece of advice before leaving. The video should have a shaky, candid, 'shot-on-a-mobile-phone' feel.
**Audio:** Chip's voice is fast-paced, high-pitched but masculine, and full of technical jargon. The sound of gentle waves and distant seagulls is in the background. He says, 'Register for 'Accelerate AI with Cloud Run' workshops, and learn how to run your AI workloads in production.'
