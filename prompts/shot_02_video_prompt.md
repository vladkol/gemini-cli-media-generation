**Master Shot Prompt (Shot 2)**

*   **Scene Description:** Using the approved keyframe, this shot features Capy the capybara walking towards the camera along the waterline of the sunny beach. His paws are on the wet sand near the gentle waves. The scene is consistent with the first shot.
*   **Action:** Capy walks with a friendly and confident gait directly towards the camera, getting closer as the shot progresses. His mouth moves in perfect sync with the dialogue. The camera remains steady, creating a smooth, high-quality feel.
*   **Audio - Dialogue:**
    *   **Speaker:** Capy (the capybara)
    *   **Dialogue:** "Register now! And I'll see you there!"
    *   **Voice:** The voice is consistent with the first shot: a deep, resonant, warm, and friendly "surfer dude" cadence with clear articulation.
*   **Audio - Soundscape:**
    *   **Ambiance:** The gentle sound of ocean waves and distant seagulls continues.
    *   **Music:** The subtle, upbeat ukulele track continues, perhaps with a slightly faster tempo to match Capy's walk.
