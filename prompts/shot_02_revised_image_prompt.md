Using the previous shot's image as a reference, create a new keyframe where the capybara is walking *along the waterline* towards the camera. Its paws should be on the wet sand right where the gentle waves are washing up. The capybara should be captured mid-stride, looking directly at the camera with a friendly expression. The style, character, and environment must remain consistent with the first shot. The image must be in a 16:9 aspect ratio.
