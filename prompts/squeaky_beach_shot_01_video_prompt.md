A close-up, eye-level shot of the squirrel from the image, who is wearing tiny black aviator sunglasses and sitting in a tiny beach chair on a beautiful white sand beach. Next to him is a small sandcastle with a tiny flag that says 'Cloud Run'. He is holding an acorn and gesturing wildly with it. The background shows a calm, turquoise ocean with gentle waves. The shot is framed as if it were taken on a mobile phone, with a slight, natural shake. The squirrel begins to talk in a frantic, high-pitched, and fast-paced voice, with perfect lip-sync. He says: "Hey AI devs! Are your models stuck in the mud? Then you gotta come to the Accelerate AI with Cloud Run workshops! It's nuts how fast you'll be!" The audio is a mix of his clear voice, the gentle sound of waves, and a distant seagull.
